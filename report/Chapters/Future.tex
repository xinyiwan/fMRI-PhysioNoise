The validity of Physio Denoise need to be examined in the future work.
One way to execute this essential work is to compare the results with others from existing tools.
The preliminary idea is applying different physiologically denoising tools to the raw data.
Several typical ROIs are chosen to compare the predicted noise signal, raw signal and denoised signal.
The performance of different noise models, such as
the variance, Signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) and R-Squared, will be used as main criteria.
