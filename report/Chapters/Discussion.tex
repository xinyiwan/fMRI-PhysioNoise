Physio Denoise is a robust denoising tool for fMRI data. 
Proceeding the raw txt file of physiological data with advanced biosignal detecting tools, 
Physio Denoise could calculate the regressors for RETROICOR model directly.
In the meanwhile, Physio Denoise has strong visualization in outputs.
Important figures in the main step are generated for users to better understand the process.
And intermediate varaibles are able to trace back the calculating process.
In the results, all the noise components of high contrast 
are shown in the background of a structural brain image, which
is easy to relate brain structure to the possible reasons for explaining the noise.
The spectrum of predicted noise could also be used to analyze noise in frequency domain.

However, there are still several crucial problems and concern with Physio Denoise.

First, the whole inplementation of Physio Noise is based on RETROICOR and GLM. 
However, the nuisance regressors in the noise model are not completely linear independent 
and may exhibit shared variance.\cite{bright2017potential} Those correlated regressors might 
add more difficulty to interpreting the influence from each component.
One possible solution to this problem is to include additional combined regressors from
both respiratory and cardiac signals. Then the influence from correlated regressors 
could be taken into consideration.
