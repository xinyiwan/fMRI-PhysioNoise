## Introduction

- Brief intro of the purpose of tools for denoising
- purpose

Physiological noise is one of the significant motion in functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI). fMRI uses magnetic imaging to measure brain activity by measuring changes in local oxygenation of blood, which in turn reflects the amount of local brain activity.[1]

Physiological pulsations related to cardiac and breathing would perturb blood-oxygen level contrast(BOLD), which may lead to less statistical sensitivity to some task-related research. Moreover, for resting-state fMRI data, problems caused by physiological noise could be more severe to the plausibility of research.
